You speak with the old man. He greets you warmly 
as if you were old friends. You feel at ease with 
him.  
"Hello adventurer! Top of the morning to you! You 
seem like a young and energetic explorer. If 
you're brave enough, your destiny awaits within 
this cave. That destiny will manifest itself as a 
portal. Enter this portal and begin the next 
chapter of your life." 
The old man sees the shock on your face and 
smiles a comforting smile, "I am but a fragile 
old man, and cannot accompany you through this 
cave, but what I can provide are a few simple 
spells that will help you along your way. Just 
read my old manuscripts and tryout those spells."
