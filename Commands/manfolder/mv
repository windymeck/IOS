NAME

        mv -- move files

SYNOPSIS
        mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source target
        mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source ... directory

DESCRIPTION

        In its first form, the mv utility renames the file named by the source
        operand to the destination path named by the target operand.  This form
        is assumed when the last operand does not name an already existing direc-
        tory.

        In its second form, mv moves each file named by a source operand to a
        destination file in the existing directory named by the directory oper-
        and.  The destination path for each operand is the pathname produced by
        the concatenation of the last operand, a slash, and the final pathname
        component of the named file.
