NAME
       ls - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
       ls [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       List  information  about  the FILEs (the current directory by default).
       Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort  is  speci‚Äê
       fied.
    
       We differentiate the files and the directories by using the stat system call. If the        fstats.st_mode & S_IFDIR is true that mean that it is a directory otherwise it is a file.


       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options are mandatory for short options
       too.
