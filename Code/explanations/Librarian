"Hm? Oh, hello. I apologize for the mess, but I'm 
very busy doing research on the dark wizard. 
Would you do me a favor? Go look up all 
references to DarkWizard in the History of 
Terminus. My assistant Grep can help you." Grep 
eyes you balefully. "Greeepp." "To search the 
contents of the book, just type "grep PHRASE 
ITEM", where PHRASE is the phrase you want to 
search for, and ITEM is the name of the book you 
want to search. Try it with the PracticeBook here 
- see if you can find the line with the word 
'peppers' in it."
