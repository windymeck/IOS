NAME

	cd- This command changes the shell working directory and prints the name of the new path by the console.

SYNOPSIS
	cd [dir].

DESCRIPTION

	Change the current directory to “dir”. The value of the home shell variable is the default directory. We get the current working directory and we print it.
	Then we change the directory to our input directory and we obtain the directory after the change, printing the name of this new path.

SEE ALSO

	-bash(1)
	-chdir()
	-getcwd()

REPORTING BUGS

	The chdir() system call is not being well executed because the programm does not change the directory.
